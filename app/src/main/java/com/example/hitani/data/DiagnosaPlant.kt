        "Common rust" to "Unfortunately, there is no easy treatment for rust. Remove all infected parts and destroy them. Clean away all debris in between plants to prevent rust from spreading. Avoid splashing water onto the leaves, as this can help spread rust.",
        "Gray leaf spot" to "Avoid application of soluble nitrogen fertilizers on moderately shaded lawns during summer months. Apply water early in the morning only when it is needed. Avoid evening waterings which keep the leaf surface wet for long periods. Several fungicides are recommended for gray leaf spot control.",
        "Northern Leaf Blight" to "Control of this disease is often focused on management and prevention. The fungus that causes this infection needs between six and 18 hours of leaf wetness to develop, so water only when needed. If you have a bad infection, you may want to try a chemical treatment." ,
        "Healthy" to "Your plant seems to be healthy.",
        "Bacterial Leaf Blight" to "Copper fungicides are recommended but need to be applied early in the disease cycle to be effective. Crop rotation can be an effective method to avoid inoculum from a previously infected crop. To prevent the spread of disease, limit cultivation to times when the foliage is dry.",
        "Brown Spot" to "Remove old vegetable debris in the garden and do not plant new crops where host plants were once growing. There are no recognized chemical treatments for bacterial leaf spot disease.",
        "Leaf Smut" to "Remove the diseased leaves and dispose of them. Also prune away and discard any infected canes. In the fall, remove all leaves and plant debris to prevent black spot from overwintering and returning in the spring, when new growth begins. Even a harsh winter wonâ€™t kill spores that may be lying dormant in your garden.",
        "Unknown" to "We weren't able to accurately identify the disease. Please try a different picture")
